# ABEL-Processor
The purpose of this repo is to provide a set of scripts to process ABEL output into files more suited for onboarding. Timeout errors are very common for even moderate sized files; this set of scripts processes the ABEL output into config files containing a single device, as a workaround to avoid timeout errors.
